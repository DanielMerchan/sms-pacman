# Pac-Man for the Sega Master System
A homebrew re-implementation of **Pac-Man** for the Sega Master System, built as a self-learning project using **devkitSMS** and the SDCC toolchain.

This project is currently in progress — a larger and more detailed README is coming soon.

    - I had to continue the tutorial in Windows (not Mac) for using [SMS Tile Studio](https://github.com/xfixium/smstilestudio). However, it is buggy for me when ordering Palette colours and changing them. Once fixed, I will upload the `SMSTileStudio` associated project

## 📝 Project Goal
Recreate **Pac-Man** gameplay on the Sega Master System as faithfully as possible while learning:

- SMS hardware basics
